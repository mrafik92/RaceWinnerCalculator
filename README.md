MYLAPS Sports Timing offers the best-in-class sports timing systems to measure, publish and analyze
race and practice results for all sports. 


Requirements
1. A race consists of up to five drivers racing around the track for a fixed number of laps (driving from the start/finish line to the start/finish line).
2. The kart number and the time of day are measured by the timing system each time a 
driver passes the start/finish line of the racing track. The software should accept these lap times in the form of the attached karttimes.csv file.
3. The race is finished when one of the drivers completes all laps.
4. The winner of a race is the driver who has driven the fastest lap.
5. The application should return the winner of the race, including the winning lap.
